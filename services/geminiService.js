and return ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no extra text).

FOCUS AREAS:
1) Sugar (per serving)
2) Hidden sugars
3) Preservatives
4) Additives / colours / flavour enhancers
5) Overall vegetarian status and health impact

User profile:
- Vegetarian type: ${userProfile.vegType}
- Health goal: ${userProfile.goal}

When writing "healthInsight", adapt it to this goal.

Use this schema exactly:

{
  "productName": "short name of the product",
  "vegetarianStatus": "Vegetarian / Non-Vegetarian / Vegan / Unclear",
  "healthScore": "number (0-100), based on how well this product fits the user profile and goal. 100 is excellent, 0 is terrible.",
  "healthInsight": "one sentence (max ~25 words) overall verdict for a typical Indian consumer, personalised to the user's health goal.",
  "servingDescription": "serving size and unit if available, e.g. 30 g (1 pack)",
  "calories": "number (kcal per serving)",
  "protein": "number (g per serving)",
  "totalFat": "number (g per serving)",
  "sugar": {
    "labelSugar": "number (g per serving as written in the nutrition table, 0 if missing)",
    "estimatedTotalSugar": "string like '8-10' for estimated g per serving including hidden sugars",
    "hiddenSugars": [
      "list of ingredient names that are sugars or sugar derivatives"
    ],
    "sugarComment": "one short sentence about sugar risk"
  },
  "preservatives": [
    {
      "name": "e.g. Sodium benzoate",
      "concern": "one short sentence on potential issues"
    }
  ],
  "additives": [
    {
      "name": "e.g. MSG",
      "concern": "one short sentence about possible effects"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Prefer PER SERVING values over per 100 g.
- If a field is unknown, use a sensible default: numbers as "0" and strings as "Unknown".
- **healthScore**: Be strict. High sugar/preservatives should lower the score significantly for weight loss/health goals.
- Output must be ONLY the JSON.
